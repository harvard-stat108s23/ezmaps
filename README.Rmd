# ezmaps

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ezmaps is to help beginners conduct exploratory analysis of geospatial data via interactive visualizations. This package helps create the following: point maps, choropleth maps, cartograms, and hexbin maps. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ezmaps from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("harvard-stat108s23/ezmaps")
```

## Functions and examples

You can find these and more code examples for `ezmaps` under `vignettes`.

### pointmap()

The `pointmap()` function plots geographic latitude/longitude data on an interactive map. Points can be colored according to the values of a variable. 

This function has the following inputs:

* Required - data, longitude_var, latitude_var, set_longitude, set_latitude
* Optional - popups, icon_filepath, icon_width, icon_height, zoom_min, zoom_max, set_zoom, map_tile, point_color, point_radius, point_inopacity, point_outopacity, user_pal, user_var

If you are creating a point map with circle markers, you are able to use the following inputs: popups, zoom_min, zoom_max, set_zoom, map_tile, point_color, point_radius, point_inopacity, point_outopacity, user_pal, user_var

If you are creating a point map with icon markers, you are able to use the following inputs: popups, icon_filepath, icon_width, icon_height, zoom_min, zoom_max, set_zoom, map_tile


### choropleth()

The `choropleth()` function plots regions and colors the regions according to the values of a variable. 

This function has the following inputs:

* Required - data, variable, geometry
* Optional - palette

```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=9}
library(ezmaps)
choropleth(data = states, 
           variable = "Population", 
           geometry = geometry, 
           palette = "viridis")
```

### cartogram()

The `cartogram()` function plots regions and distorts their size and shape according to the values of a variable. The regions can optionally be colored according to the values of that variable or of another  variable.

This function has the following inputs:

* Required - data, weight, variable, geometry
* Optional - base


```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=9}
library(ezmaps)
cartogram(data = states, 
          weight = "Population", 
          variable = "Vegetables", 
          geometry = geometry, 
          palette = "viridis",
          base = 1)
```

### hexbin()

The `hexbin()` function plots a hexagonal grid fitted to the original geometry of the geographic regions of interest. Each hexagon represents one region and is labeled accordingly. The hexagons are colored according to the values of a variable.

This function has the following inputs:

* Required - data, fill, labels, geometry
* Optional - palette, seed

### tessellate()

The `tessellate()` function is an optional function that allows the user to preview configurations of hexagonal grids ("seed maps") across the original geometry of the geographic regions of interest. To use this function, the user must call `tessellate()` before `hexbin()`. The user can then input one of the seed maps created using `tessellate()` as the base grid used by the `hexbin()` function using the `hexbin(seed)` argument. 

This function has the following inputs:

* Required - data, fill, geometry
* Optional - n


```{r,fig.width=9,fig.height=9}
library(ezmaps)
tessellate(data = states, geometry = geometry, n = 6)
hexbin(data = states,
       fill = "Vegetables",
       labels = "STUSPS",
       geometry = geometry,
       palette = "viridis",
       seed = 4)
```

## Datasets

### crash_data
A tibble with 1311 rows and 5 variables. Contains information on local pedestrian/cyclist crashes in Cambridge, MA, United States. [Source](https://github.com/harvard-stat108s23/materials/blob/main/psets/data/cambridge_cyclist_ped_crash.csv)

### states
A simple-feature dataframe with 50 rows and 7 variables. Contains information on the residents of US states and multipolygon/shapefile data for the geometries of US states using a combination of the [Lock5Data::USStates](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lock5Data/index.html) & [tigris::states](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris/blob/master/R/states.R) datasets, respectively.
